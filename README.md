POST MORTEM
So the game is submitted, but the week did not go as intended. i only got about 9-10 hours to work on the game, and could not finish the main goal in time.

I also had some issues with the build process, that i could not solve before the time was up.

Things i would want to do differently is a better alien model, fix some of the bugs with collision and movement and finish up the main game loop.


I might come back and fix some of the issues after the voting period.
