# DeepSpaceDread Active Context

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Player Controls**
   - Input system implementation
   - Movement mechanics
   - Interaction system (picking up and throwing objects)
   - Inventory system (InventoryController)

2. **Animation System**
   - Player state machines
   - Basic alien behaviors implemented (hunting, chasing, attacking)
   - Environmental animations (doors, terminals)

3. **UI Development**
   - Main game HUD
   - Interaction prompts
   - Menu systems

## Recent Changes
- Implemented basic player movement controls
- Set up animation controllers for core characters
- Created initial UI layout
- Configured URP settings
- Implemented inventory and interaction logic in PlayerController
- Implemented SimpleEffectController for visual and audio feedback
- Implemented TypewriterEffect for animated text in UI
- Implemented Timer for managing game time
- Implemented SoundManager for playing audio cues

## Active Decisions
- Input binding scheme for controller support
- Animation blending approaches
- UI Toolkit vs uGUI for certain elements
- Audio implementation strategy

## Next Steps
1. Refine player movement feel
2. Further refine alien AI behaviors (corpse eating, improved hunting)
3. Expand UI functionality
4. Integrate audio triggers
5. Develop environmental interactions (using RaycastTentacles, TentacleMover, and Tentacle)
- Updated RaycastTentacles.cs to potentially improve tentacle movement
