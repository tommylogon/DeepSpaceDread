- ðŸš§ Audio implementation

## Known Issues
1. Player movement needs polishing
2. Some animation transitions are rough
3. UI needs responsive scaling
4. Audio mixing not finalized

## Pending Tasks
- Implement save system
- Develop tutorial/intro sequence
- Further refine alien AI behaviors (corpse eating, improved hunting)
- Expand environment interactions
- Optimize rendering pipeline
