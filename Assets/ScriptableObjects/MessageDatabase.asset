      Station. Sources claim that the reactor reached critical levels, leading to
      a massive explosion. While the official statement attributes this to a technical

      a deliberate act, preventing an unknown threat from spreading throughout the
      galaxy. The heroic sacrifice of the crew members will not be forgotten.
